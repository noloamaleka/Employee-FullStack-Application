A full-stack web application built with React, MongoDB, Express.js, and Mongoose. This employee directory allows users to view and filter employee payroll information by department. The backend API, built with Express.js, interacts with a MongoDB database to retrieve and store data, while the frontend, developed in React, provides an intuitive user interface for managing and displaying employee data.

## **How to Run the Application**:

Clone the repository.

Navigate to the project directory.

Install the required dependencies:
npm install

Start the backend server:
npm run server

In a new terminal start the frontend server:
npm start

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application

Kindly note that MongoDB needs to be installed locally and run locally
